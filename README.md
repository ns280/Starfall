# Instructions
**Objective:** Survive as long as possible, collect stars, and achieve the highest score while avoiding planets and a relentless enemy ship.

## Gameplay:

1. **Movement:**
    *   Use the **Arrow Keys** or **WASD** to control your ship's movement.
        *   Up/W: Move forward.
        *   Down/S: Move backward.
        *   Left/A: Turn left.
        *   Right/D: Turn right.
        *   If no arrow is pressed, your ship will face up.

2. **Gravity:**
    *   **Green Planets:** Pull you towards them. Use their gravity to your advantage, but be careful not to crash!
    *   **Red Planets:** Push you away. Use them to alter your trajectory or escape tight spots.
    *   **Enemy Ship:** The enemy ship will not push or pull you.

3. **Stars:**
    *   **White Stars:** Collect these to increase your score.

4. **Enemy Ship:**
    *   A red enemy ship will chase you throughout the game.
    *   It will fire yellow bullets at you.
    *   Getting hit by bullets depletes your health.
    *   If you crash into the enemy ship you die.
    *   The number of shots it takes to defeat you depends on the difficulty setting.

5. **Health:**
    *   Your health is displayed in the top-right corner as a green bar.
    *   When your health reaches zero, the game is over.

6. **Difficulty:**
    *   Before starting the game, use the difficulty slider to adjust the challenge:
        *   **Easy (Left):** Fewer planets, weaker gravity, slower enemy, more health.
        *   **Hard (Right):** More planets, stronger gravity, faster enemy, less health.
    *   The difficulty also affects the number of shots needed to deplete your health and enemy speed.

7. **Volume:**
    *   Adjust the background music volume using the slider on the landing page.
        *   **Leftmost**: Mute.
        *   **Rightmost**: Full volume.

8. **Teleportation:**
    *   If you fly off-screen, you'll reappear on the opposite side of the screen.

9. **Game Over:**
    *   The game ends when your health reaches zero (hit by too many bullets or crash into the enemy ship) or if you collide with a planet.
    *   Your score will be displayed, and you can choose to play again.
    *   Your best score is saved and displayed on the landing page.

## Tips for Success:

*   Use the planets' gravity to slingshot yourself around the map.
*   Learn to anticipate the enemy ship's movements and bullet trajectory.
*   Practice makes perfect! The more you play, the better you'll become at navigating the challenging environment.

**Have fun and good luck in the Starfall!**
